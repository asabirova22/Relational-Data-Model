# Relational-Data-Model
A project to implement a small-scale relational database system in C, focusing on the concepts of relational algebra and the relational data model. This project involved designing and building a system capable of representing relations, performing relational algebra operations, and querying the data using a structured syntax. Implemented core operations, such as selection, projection, union, intersection, and Cartesian product. Each operation was designed to work dynamically based on input relations and constraints. 

Building: gcc -std=c99 -Wall -Werror -o relations relations.c
Running: ./relations

// Note that we used -1 to represent * in our code only for player ids
Also note that in part three number 4 there are no tuples that come out of that value 
as there are no races ran on that date
